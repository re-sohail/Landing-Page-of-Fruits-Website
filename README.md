# Landing-Page-of-Fruits-Website

The **<body>** element is the container for the visible content of the webpage.
Inside the **<body>** element, there is a **<div>** element with the id **"main"** that serves as the main container for the page content.
The content is divided into two sections: the left section and the right section.
The left section contains a **<div>** element with the id "left". Within it, there is another **<div>** element with the id "left-nav" that represents a navigation area.
Inside the "left-nav" section, there is an arrow icon represented by the **<i>** element with the class "ri-arrow-left-line". Below the arrow, there is a **<div>** element with the id "left-nav-top" which contains links for "Home" and "Work", and a Twitter icon represented by the **<i>** element with the class "ri-twitter-fill".
Below the "left-nav" section, there is a **<div>** element with the id "text". It contains an **<h1>** element with the text "Hello," indicating a greeting, a **<p>** element with a quote about summer and ripe fruit, and an <a> element with a "Read" link.
The right section contains a **<div>** element with the id "right". It consists of a top area with two empty **<div>** elements, one with the id "left1" and the other with the id "right1".
Below the top area, there is a **<div>** element with the id "right-bottom".
Overall, this HTML code structure represents a landing page with a navigation area on the left side, a greeting and quote on the left side, and a visually divided right side with placeholders for additional content.
